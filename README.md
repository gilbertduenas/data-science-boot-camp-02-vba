# Objectives
Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.

Display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

# Results
See the attached PNG files.

The script runs on all sheets in the workbook.

However, the run time exceeded 6 hours. Optimization is needed.
